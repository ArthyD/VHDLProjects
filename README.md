# My VHDL Projects

These are my academic projects done with VHDL

## E0 implementation

This project aims to implement the E0 crypto algorithm (for bluetooth communication). It is based on LFSR to generate pseudo random bit sequence.

## Kogge-Stone adder

This project implements a trade-off design between ripple carry adders and carry lookahead adders for a 64 bits adder.

## RISC-V implementation

This project provides a functionnal model and a RTL model implementing the RISC-V processor design.
